# NumPy Array Manipulation
This Python project demonstrates basic operations using the NumPy library for array manipulation and mathematical operations.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required library using the following command:
   pip install numpy pandas
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file (main.py).
5. Run the program using a Python interpreter. The program will execute and display various NumPy operations.
